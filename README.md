# My Articles Blogs and Interests and more...
I am Bhakti Raut, an engineering student (2nd year) at Yeshwatrao Chavan College of Engineering, Nagpur, Maharashtra, India. I am a physics and mathematics enthusiast and engineering makes me aware of the real-world applications of both. 
#### "As much as I love science and its technological impact, its overwhelming questions and mysteries, what interests me the most about it, is the realization that even if I am unable to get to the correct answer to a problem, I will still have something to hold on to and think upon, the fact that you can be wrong but never actually fail while studying science intrigued me and inspired me to choose it as my goal."
